lyria's "cover" component.

Usage: `lyria cover [target] [cover] [-r|--recursive] [--dry-run] [-f|--force]`

Scans selected [path], defaults to the current directory, for music files.
If used [-r|--recursive], also scans sub-directories.

Sets a cover image from [cover] to every file.
If there already is a cover, it will not replace it unless [-f|--force] is specified.

You can specify [--dry-run] to to only parse files without fetching lyrics.
