Lyria's "lyrics" component.

Usage: `lyria lyrics [path] [-r|--recursive] [--dry-run]`
Alternative: `lyria` same as `lyria lyrics .`

Scans selected [path], defaults to the current directory, for music files.
If used [-r|--recursive], also scans sub-directories.

Then fetches synced lyrics, and writes it to the same path as file, with .lrc extension
If synced lyrics can't be found, lyria will try to write normal lyrics, 
  and if those can't be found, it'll move on with a warning.

You can specify [--dry-run] to to only parse files without fetching lyrics.
