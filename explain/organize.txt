Lyria's "organizer" component.

Usage: `lyria organize [target] [source] [--dry-run]`

Iterates through every music file in [source] and reorganizes it in [target].
The structure will look something like that:
  Artist/Album/Disc-Track Title.Extension
For example:
  Ado/Kyougen/01-11 Usseewa.mp3

Songs without the album tag, will be placed in:
  Artist/Disc-Track Title.Extension

Songs without disc or track number will be renamed to only contain the title:
  Artist/Album/Title.Extension

Songs without Artist tag will not be processed.

Source folder will not be iterated recursively, even if [-r|--recursive] is specified.
You shuold put all songs in root of the source directory.

You can specify [--dry-run] to to only parse files without moving them.
